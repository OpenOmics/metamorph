## Overview
Welcome to metamorph! Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through [metamorph's documentation](https://openomics.github.io/metamorph/).

The **`./metamorph`** pipeline is composed several inter-related sub commands to setup and run the pipeline across different systems. Each of the available sub commands perform different functions: 

 * [<code>metamorph <b>run</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/metamorph/usage/run/): Run the metamorph pipeline with your input files.
 * [<code>metamorph <b>unlock</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/metamorph/usage/unlock/): Unlocks a previous runs output directory.
 * [<code>metamorph <b>cache</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/metamorph/usage/cache/): Cache remote resources locally, coming soon!

**metamorph** is a comprehensive workflow that starts off with assembly of short read DNA sequencing data (metagenome) to build contigs for each individual sample, followed by contig binning. Good quality genomic bins from all samples are futher combined and dereplicated to generate representative metagenome-assembled genomes or MAGs. These MAGs are further classified, quantified, and used to predict functional profiles. The short read DNA sequencing data (metatranscriptome) mapping to MAGs is used for functional profiling. It relies on technologies like [Singularity<sup>1</sup>](https://singularity.lbl.gov/) to maintain the highest-level of reproducibility. The pipeline consists of a series of data processing and quality-control steps orchestrated by [Snakemake<sup>2</sup>](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a flexible and scalable workflow management system, to submit jobs to a cluster.

The pipeline is compatible with data generated from Illumina short-read sequencing technologies. As input, it accepts a set of FastQ files and can be run locally on a compute instance or on-premise using a cluster. A user can define the method or mode of execution. The pipeline can submit jobs to a cluster using a job scheduler like SLURM (more coming soon!). A hybrid approach ensures the pipeline is accessible to all users.

Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through the [usage](https://openomics.github.io/metamorph/usage/run/) section of each available sub command.

## Dependencies
**Requires:** `singularity>=3.5`  `snakemake>=6.0`

At the current moment, the pipeline uses a mixture of enviroment modules and docker images; however, this will be changing soon! In the very near future, the pipeline will only use docker images. With that being said, [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) and [singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/all-releases) must be installed on the target system. Snakemake orchestrates the execution of each step in the pipeline. To guarantee the highest level of reproducibility, each step of the pipeline will rely on versioned images from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/nciccbr/repositories). Snakemake uses singularity to pull these images onto the local filesystem prior to job execution, and as so, snakemake and singularity will be the only two dependencies in the future.

## Installation
Please clone this repository to your local filesystem using the following command:
```bash
# Clone Repository from Github
git clone https://github.com/OpenOmics/metamorph.git
# Change your working directory
cd metamorph/
# Add dependencies to $PATH
# Biowulf users should run
module load snakemake singularity
# Get usage information
./metamorph -h
```
